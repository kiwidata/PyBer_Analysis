# PyBer_Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to show a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type, and to create a graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results

The results below provides an overview of the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type between January to April 2019.

The table above shows that Urban areas consists of the majority of total rides (approx 69%), and drivers (80%), while Suburban, and especially Rural areas has a much smaller percentage of total rides (26% and 5% repectively), and drivers (17% and 3% repectively).

The average fare per ride, however, is much larger as you go from Urban ($24.5) to Rural ($34.6). This is even more prononced with the average Fare per driver going from $16.6 in Urban areas to $55.48 in Rural areas.

Based on the graph below, Urban cities still makes the biggest percentage of fare per month even if the average fare is lower than the rural cities. This is due to the large amount of riders in the urban centers.

## Summary

Recommentions to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

1) Try to increase the amount of drivers in rural and suburban areas if possible. That might lower the disparity between city types.
2) Potentialy change the way of charging the customers in urban areas (maybe as a function of time) since the fare per driver is low compared to other city types.
3) Adjust the number of drivers in city type based on the demand (for specific month).
